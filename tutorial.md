This tutorial series describes the Regent programming language and the
most common features used in Regent to build parallel and distributed
programs. Each tutorial comes with a complete and working example
program. (The complete source code can also be found in the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion/tree/master/tutorial).)
In order to follow along with the examples, it is recommended to
install Regent via the [quickstart guide]({{ "install/#quickstart" |
relative_url }}) first.
